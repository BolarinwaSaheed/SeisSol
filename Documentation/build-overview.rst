Building SeisSol
================

Welcome to the instructions for installing and running SeisSol. Therefore, this page serves as a high-level gateway to the individual steps of the build process.
To the current state, SeisSol has many dependencies due to a large amount of code generators, math libraries, and programming models (yes, all three of them).

Thus, we recommend using the Spack package. Click HERE, for instructions to do that.

Otherwise, if the spack package does not work, you can also install SeisSol on your own.

* Start by installing dependencies. See the instructions HERE.

* Then, compile SeisSol. See the instructions HERE.


Once you are done, you can test your installation by running some examples.
